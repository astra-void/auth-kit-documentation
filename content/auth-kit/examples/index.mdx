# Examples

Here are complete authentication examples using @astra-void/auth-kit.
Each example includes full source code and a working implementation.

### Email / Password

Basic email and password login using JWT sessions.

- Registration and login flow
- Secure cookie-based session management
- Protected routes with middleware

### Passkey (Email-first)

WebAuthn passkey login that begins with email input.

- Email → challenge → biometric login
- Redis-backed challenge store
- Works with platform authenticators (Face ID, Touch ID)

### Passkey (Credential-Only)

Pure WebAuthn login without requiring an email prompt.

- Fully passwordless
- Supports conditional UI (Chrome, Safari)
- FIDO2 cross-device login support

> ⚠️ Note:
Credential-only login does not ask the user to enter their email.
This means the browser must try to match all stored credentials.
If a user has many registered accounts on a device, this may lead to degraded performance or slower UI rendering during login.
For better performance at scale, consider using email-first instead.
